Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (v14 or later)
npm or Yarn
PostgreSQL (for local development or access to AWS RDS)
AWS CLI (optional, for managing AWS resources from the command line)
Setup
1. Clone the Repository
bash
Copiar código
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
2. Install Dependencies
bash
Copiar código
npm install
# or
yarn install
3. Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory of your project. Copy and paste the following template and fill in the required values:

makefile
Copiar código
# Next.js Environment Variables
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Prisma Environment Variables
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE?schema=public

# AWS Credentials (Optional)
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key-id
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-access-key
Replace USER, PASSWORD, HOST, PORT, and DATABASE with your PostgreSQL credentials. For local development, you can use a local PostgreSQL instance or an AWS RDS instance.

4. Prisma Setup
Run the following command to generate Prisma client and set up the database schema:

bash
Copiar código
npx prisma generate
npx prisma migrate dev
If you have existing migrations, you can run:

bash
Copiar código
npx prisma migrate deploy
Configuration
1. Next.js Configuration
Next.js configuration is managed through next.config.js. Customize this file to add additional settings or environment variables as needed.

2. Prisma Configuration
Prisma configuration is found in prisma/schema.prisma. Update this file to manage your data models and relationships.

Development
To start the development server, run:

bash
Copiar código
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
The application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

Code Formatting
Ensure your code adheres to formatting standards by using Prettier. You can format your code by running:

bash
Copiar código
npm run format
# or
yarn format
Linting
To lint your code, use ESLint:

bash
Copiar código
npm run lint
# or
yarn lint
Deployment
Deploying to Vercel
Create a Vercel Account: If you don't have one, sign up at Vercel.
Connect Your Repository: Import your project repository into Vercel.
Set Environment Variables: Configure environment variables in Vercel's dashboard to match those in your .env file.
Deploy: Vercel will automatically build and deploy your application on each push to the main branch.
Deploying to AWS
Create an EC2 Instance: Launch an EC2 instance with Node.js installed.
Install Dependencies: SSH into your instance and clone the repository. Run npm install or yarn install to install dependencies.
Configure Environment Variables: Set environment variables on the EC2 instance.
Start the Application: Run npm run start or yarn start to start your application.
For production use, consider using a process manager like PM2 to manage your Node.js application.

Database Management
Migrations
Run migrations to apply schema changes:

bash
Copiar código
npx prisma migrate dev
For production environments:

bash
Copiar código
npx prisma migrate deploy
Seeding the Database
To seed the database with initial data, create a prisma/seed.ts file and run:

bash
Copiar código
npx ts-node prisma/seed.ts
Database Connection
Ensure your database connection string in .env is correctly configured to connect to your PostgreSQL instance.

Scripts
Development: npm run dev or yarn dev
Build: npm run build or yarn build
Start: npm run start or yarn start
Lint: npm run lint or yarn lint
Format: npm run format or yarn format

<!-- This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started



First, run the development server:

```bash
# 1
npm install
# 2 - for this command you will need the .env with the DATABASE_URL
npx prisma db pull
# 3
npx prisma generate
# 4
npm run seed
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
